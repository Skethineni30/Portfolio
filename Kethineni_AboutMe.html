         <p> Hello! My name is Surya Kethineni and I'm an engineering student at Dublin High School. Some goals I have for this year are to get an A in the class and to become a pro in HTML and CSS. I plan to work hard every day and focus during class, but to also have fun. I try not to act serious, but I make sure I finish my code and my work. This is my goal because in the field I want to go into, it requires a lot of HTML and CSS because I want to become a coder and make websites. And due to the shelter in place, I've had more times to work on these skills and become a master.
        </p>

        <p> Some characteristics I possess are the ability to use resources and to get help. This helps me solve problems that I don't know how to face. I learn the best when I ask questions and get help from people comfortable with it. With my newly acquired knowledge, I can help other students with their code and solve their problems. Some of my major achievements in coding are creating unique games. One other major accomplishment is making all this content and website from scratch. I created this website using the bootstrap CSS template. I used HTML to develop all the text and images on my website. Creating this web site will be one of the many accomplishments that I plan to add on my resume. Another achievement I have is the life scout award. Life scout is the second-highest award in boy scouts. I am very honored to have these achievements to my name and so close to my heart that they can be connected by a bridge.
        </p> 
    
        <p>This leads me to my abilities in my future work experiences. Some work abilities I have are the ability to help others and I have some work/volunteering experience. I have learned that you should always be kind to the customer or consumer. Even if the customer or consumer is mad, being nice with them will lower their rage and will improve your company. This will help me in my field, my future, and my entire life because I want to get into engineering with a hint of business. Overall, I am glad to be at Dublin high and to be making this about me page. I thank you the reader, for your time. I hope you have learned many things about this engineering program and all about me and my time here.
