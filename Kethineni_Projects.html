  <strong><h1>Scratch Project</h1></strong>  
  <h3>This project was done in CSP and was finished in September of 2019</h3>
  <p>In the scratch project, me and Amrith KrishnaKumar created a player based story on a robber named Bob. The robber aimed to steal from a library. The player had to make the moves of moving left, or right. If he moved left, he would get a guitar. If he moved right. He would get the baseball. A cop comes and you must run away. You must escape, or else you will lose. Play to find out how Bob will run away from the cop. </p>

    <strong><h1>MIT App Inventor Project</h1></strong>
    <h3> This project was done in CSP during September and October of 2019</h3>
    <p>In my app inventor project, Aadi Sharma and I created a game called Collect the Gold. The game was based on Get the Gold, a game given my MIT app inventor. In the game, ou use the wasd keys and move around as a pirate ship. Coins spawn all around the map and you must collect them. The coins change locations every couple seconds. There is an enemy in the middle and if you touch it, you lose. The enemy also moves around every couple seconds. Collect all the coins to win.</p>

  <strong><h1>HTML Project</h1></strong>
  <h3>This project was done in CSP during September and October of 2019</h3>
  <p>In this project, I created this website. I worked for weeks on this project to finally master HTML and CSS, but to also make my first complete website. But, I have to thank my classmates for helping me. There were many things I did not know, and they helped me understand what i'm doing. This project was not a partner project like the others so I was the only one handling on it. In this project, I learned how to find information quickly and how to cross road bumps in my code. I made this whole website from scratch and I am very proud of it. This is so far my favorite project and I can't wait to keep going in my computer science based life.</p>
